"""Cascades of price levels.

Definitions
  * A swing high (swing low) is a candle whose high (low) is the highest (lowest) among `strength` candles
    on each side of it. Only confirmed swings are used (there must be `strength` candles after it).
  * A CASCADE is a group of at least `min_extremes` swing highs (resistance) or swing lows (support) whose prices
    lie within a tolerance of each other.
    The tolerance is either a fixed percent or N "average 1-minute candles" (adapts to the volatility of the coin).
  * The LEVEL of a cascade is its most extreme price (the highest high of a resistance, the lowest low of a support).
  * A cascade is dropped as BROKEN when, after its OLDEST extreme, any candle went beyond the level (by its high / low,
    a wick counts) by more than a small buffer. Only levels that the price has never traded through are kept.
  * SCORE (0-100) of a cascade = 50 points for the number of extremes (5 or more = full) + 20 points for how long
    the cascade has existed (first to last extreme, relative to the searched history) + 30 points for the volume
    traded on the extreme candles compared with the usual candle volume (3x or more = full).
  * The distance to a cascade is measured from the current price; it is also expressed in "average 1-minute candles",
    where the average 1-minute candle is the mean (high - low) of the last hour of 1-minute candles.
  * The TREND of the approach compares the distance now with the distance a few minutes ago:
    "closing" (getting closer), "away" (moving away from the cascade) or "flat".
